## Download Data

Here, I am downloading the sample data frame into the R Markdown.

```{r sample}
df <- read.csv("data/sample_data.csv")
```

## Simple Analysis

In this portion, I am conducting simple analyses of the data, namely mean and stadnard deviation.

```{r analysis, echo=FALSE}

summary(df$MeanF0)

sd(df$MeanF0, na.rm=TRUE)

```
## Data Visualization

In this portion, I am creating a simple visualization of the data.

The figure shows the distribution of fundamental frequency by gender. 

The trend shows that on average, women tend to produce speech at a higher fundamental frequency (F0) than men.

```{r visualization, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = Gender, y = MeanF0, fill=Gender), data = df) +
  labs(title ="MeanF0 by Gender")

```
